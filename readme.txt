Note for running the experiment:
Before running the experiment, make sure that following are done:
1. Open your browser (preferably Google Chrome).
1. Switch to fullscreen in your browser. (This is important because otherwise it leads to visual defects)
2. Open the "htmlbart.html" file with your browser program.
3. If browser is not in fullscreen when you run it, press F11, then F5, then you can type in participant id and so on.
4. Make sure you checked that everything runs smoothly and without defect. Check the experiment before testing the test subject.

Note for saving data file:
The data will be downloaded after the experiment is over.
Note about csv file: the rd_time column is actually accurate, but Microsoft Excel puts some random dots every third number,
and ignores the original dot, that is there to seperate second and milisecond.
For example: 12.67699 is, in Microsoft Excel, seen as 1.267.699.
